                <p>Hi, I’m Andrea, a self-taught front-end developer with a passion for creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces. My journey into development began with curiosity and a strong desire to bring ideas to life through code. Without a team or mentor, I’ve learned to navigate the world of front-end development independently, building skills through hands-on experimentation, online resources, and a relentless drive to improve.</p>
                <p>I specialize in crafting intuitive user experiences using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Every project I’ve worked on has been a solo endeavor, which has taught me not only technical proficiency but also discipline, problem-solving, and creative thinking. From debugging tricky layout issues to implementing dynamic components, I’ve learned to rely on my own resourcefulness and persistence.</p>
                <p>Working solo has also given me the freedom to explore and shape my own development style. I’ve built projects from scratch, refined my understanding of responsive design, and stayed up-to-date with evolving trends in UI. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and designing interfaces that feel natural and engaging to users.</p>
                <p>While I haven’t collaborated with others yet, I’m excited about the possibility of working in a team environment in the future. I know that collaboration brings new perspectives and challenges, and I’m eager to grow in that direction. For now, I continue to build my portfolio, sharpen my skills, and push myself to take on more complex projects.</p>
                <p>Front-end development is more than just code to me, it’s a way to connect ideas with people through thoughtful design and interaction. I’m proud of the journey I’ve taken so far, and I look forward to what’s next as I continue to evolve as a developer.</p>
